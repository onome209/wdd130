        <p>Hello! My name is Owobu Onome Joyce and I am from Edo state, Nigeria. I graduated from the University of
            Ilorin with a degree in Anatomy and also completed my PathwayConnect program with BYU-Pathway Worldwide. I
            am now at <strong>BYU-Idaho</strong>, where I am studying <strong>Software Development</strong>.</p>
        <p>This site will be used to share my work and progress in the <em>WDD course</em>. Iâ€™m passionate about
            technology, problem-solving, and continuous learning. Outside of coding, I enjoy reading, exploring new
            ideas, and connecting with people who inspire growth.</p>
